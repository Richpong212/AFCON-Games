# Afconade Prediction Game App

The Afconade Prediction Game App is a platform designed for friends and family to engage in a friendly prediction competition, where users predict the scores of upcoming matches and earn points based on the accuracy of their predictions. The user with the highest points at the end of the tournament is declared the winner.

## Rules of the Game

   - Draw Prediction: If a user predicts a draw (e.g., 0-0), and the game ends in a draw (e.g., 1-1), the user is awarded 1 point.
   - Close Score Prediction: In cases where the predicted score is close to the actual score, 1 point is awarded. For instance, if a user predicts 2-1, and the game ends 4-0, they receive 1 point.
